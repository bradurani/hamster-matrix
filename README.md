# Hamster Matrix

Hamster Matrix is a gem providing a persietent immutable matrix for functional programming in Ruby. It is an extension for the popular [Hamster](https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster/) gem, using Hamster [Vectors](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/hamstergem/hamster/master/Hamster/Vector) under the hood.  

It's great for using as a board in 2D video games where the matrix must be modified as the game state changes while leaving references to the old state unchanged, such as when using a time-travelling debugger. It copies the interface from Ruby's [Matrix](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/matrix/rdoc/Matrix.html) class as much as possible.


## Installation
